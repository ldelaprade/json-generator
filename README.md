# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Code App was generated by Claude AI:

The question asked to Claude AI was:


**Hi,
I'd like to create an user friendly application which help me to generate a json file base on the rules defined in the json schema file: schema_model.json**

Have a look at the conversation.

* It first created a python app,
* we then asked it to translate to C# ==> the result could not build and run on linux
* we then asked it to retry using Typescript + REACT ==> result was workable !
* we then asked it to help with migrating that to Electron standalone app ==> Here is the amazing working result

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run (since it's migrated to Electron):

### npm run electron:serve

### npm run electron:build


In the project directory, you can run (before electron migration and it is still working after electron migration):

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
